<h1>David Somers-Harris</h1>
    <p>David was born in Noda, Japan to British Canadian parents. 
      Raised in a missionary family, he was exposed to music constantly throughout 
      his life. David was taught piano at a young age, and took up guitar at 11. 
      After moving to Tokyo, he took up drumming as well as he jammed often with 
      friends. He got involved in a few minor musical performances, but did not 
      make it a habit of continually playing until his family began to attend 
      Tokyo Baptist Church in 2001. TBC is where he developed his musical skills 
      and worked his way up to Youth band leader, and encountered Jeremy and Matthew 
      who would eventually form the band Cokespill along with his brother Jonny 
      as well.</p>
    <p>David is currently attending TWU (Trinity Western University) in BC, Canada 
      and is in his second year pursuing a degree in Computing Science</p>
