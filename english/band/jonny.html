<h1>Jonathan Somers-Harris</h1>
    <p>Jonathan (Jonny) was born and raised by his Canadian Mom and awesomely
	  British Dad in Japan. His father is quite content that Jonny has come
	  to resemble the deviously dashing man he sees in the mirror every
	  morning, while his mother is a bit disappointed that he failed to
	  retain the musical sight reading that she taught him at an early age.
	  Jonny first started sporadically playing guitar at age 10 but never
	  really got started until he turned 13. However, once it became
	  apparent that he could never quite overtake his brother's mad guitar
	  skills he decided to focus on the bass guitar instead, and has been
	  rather pleased by the results so far.</p>
	<p>Jonny is currently attending Trinity Western University in BC, Canada,
	  attempting somewhat strenuously to acquire his B.B.A there. He is also
	  considering a minor in worship studies but feels that his lack of
	  music theory may prove to be a hindrance</p>
	<p>Jonny would like be a rock star someday but is willing to settle for
	  the business expatriate lifestyle that he has been blessed to
	  partially experience during his final few years in Japan</p>
	<p>However, if all else fails Jonny is quite confident that he can fall
	  back on a career as a Model</p>
