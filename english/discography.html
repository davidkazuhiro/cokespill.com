    <td><p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.5em">Prepare yourself for a musically and thematically diverse road trip with <em>Moving On</em>, the debut project from Cokespill. These Japan natives have crafted an album that shows the band's strong Christian faith, but successfully finds a balance between testimony and humor. With the opening track, the listener is greeted by strong guitar punches intertwined with piano interludes while proclaiming &quot;Whatever You need to do, Lord, do in me." The band wastes no time with continuing the upbeat nature of the album with &quot;LOL,&quot; a satire of the MSN world which is fueled by hooky lyrics <em>&aacute; la</em> Relient K backed by windows-down driving music that could make one reminisce of that little tune known as &quot;Stacy's Mom.&quot; Following this is &quot;I Wanna See Jesus,&quot; a funky Fruit-Of-The-Spirit ditty. "Chambers," a piano dominated jamming session, is an instrumental interlude which segues into the rest of the album.</p>
	<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.5em">The more mellow side of Cokespill is found starting with "I Feel For You," a stripped-down acoustic guitar number with gentle vocal harmonies, finding the lead singer intimately reaching out to a hurting friend. Other tender moments on the album include the album's title track, which is the strongest song on the record. Opening with a haunting guitar and keyboard intro, the vocalist finds himself battling with the pains of a shattered relationship, pleading &quot;Heal my wounds, oh God,&quot; then triumphantly &quot;Free my mind, break me loose!&quot; along with a guitar outburst to emphasize the emotion.</p>
	<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.5em">While most of the album is original material, Cokespill throws in two popular worship songs with an entirely new twist. First is a full-out gospel rendition of &quot;There Is None Like You.&quot; Midway through the performance, the band takes you back to their roots with a Japanese-version of the song's chorus. The second selection, &quot;Heart Of Worship,&quot;gets a dynamic workout from its common ballad form as Cokespill vamps up the electric guitars.</p>
	<p class="indent" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.5em"><em>Moving On</em> is a sure sign that Cokespill is just 
        beginning to unpack its talents. Come discover an album that will entertain 
        your senses ans speak to your heart.</p>
